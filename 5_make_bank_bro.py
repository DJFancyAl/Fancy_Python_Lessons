THERE'S A CRISIS! We need to fund a new "LGBT+ program" for new migrants who are arriving from the southern border.
And money is tight because we already paid for the LGBT center in Pakistan last year, so we're gonna need the tax
payers to chip in a little more. DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE.

However, it's also election season and we can't risk upsetting our educated class. So our lord and savior (Boe Jiden)
has asked for a list of the poorest Americans at his bank.

Take a look at the list below. You need to use this list to determine the balance of each bank account. Then you need
to add the account number of each account totaling less than $6000.00 to the "poor_people" list. Lastly, print the list.

Hints:
* Look carefully at how the bank_accounts list is structured to determine how to iterate it.
* There are several ways to accomplish this, but some are more logical than others.
* Remember - your result needs to only be a list of account numbers.
